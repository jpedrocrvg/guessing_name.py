# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple Python program allows users to play a game where they try to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100.

## How to Play

1. Run the `number_guessing_game.py` script.
2. You will be prompted to choose a difficulty level: 'easy' or 'hard'.
   - In 'easy' mode, you have 10 lives.
   - In 'hard' mode, you have 5 lives.
3. Enter your guesses when prompted.
4. The program will provide feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of lives.
